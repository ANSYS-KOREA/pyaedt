Documentation for the latest stable release of PyAEDT is hosted at
`PyAEDT documentation <https://aedt.docs.pyansys.com/version/stable/>`_.

In the upper right corner of the documentation's title bar, there is an option
for switching from viewing the documentation for the latest stable release
to viewing the documentation for the development version or previously
released versions.

You can also view or download PyAEDT cheat sheets, which are one-page references
providing syntax rules and commands for using the PyAEDT API and PyEDB API:

- `View PyAEDT cheat sheet <https://cheatsheets.docs.pyansys.com/pyaedt_API_cheat_sheet.png>`_ or
