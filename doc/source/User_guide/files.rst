Load and manage files
=====================
PyAEDT supports different files formats to manage simulation and setup data.
The most used are described in this chapter.


.. grid:: 2

   .. grid-item-card:: Project  file
            :link: project
            :link-type: doc

            The project configuration file allows to apply a set of variables, materials, setup, mesh and boundaries.

   .. grid-item-card:: Report file
            :link: reports
            :link-type: doc
            :margin: 2 2 0 0

            The report configuration files allows to easily create customized AEDT reports.

   .. grid-item-card:: Materials file
            :link: materials
            :link-type: doc
            :margin: 2 2 0 0

            The report configuration files allows to import and export materials in AEDT.

   .. grid-item-card:: Primitives file
            :link: primitivesconf
            :link-type: doc
            :margin: 2 2 0 0

            Create primitives from file.

   .. grid-item-card:: Array
            :link: array
            :link-type: doc
            :margin: 2 2 0 0

            Discover how to generate parametrics models and run optimizations.

   .. grid-item-card:: Cables
            :link: cable
            :link-type: doc
            :margin: 2 2 0 0

            Usage of PyAEDT with input and output files.

   .. grid-item-card:: Choke
            :link: choke
            :link-type: doc
            :margin: 2 2 0 0

            Usage of PyAEDT with input and output files.
